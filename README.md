# Real-Time-River-Water-Quality-Monitoring-and-Control-Systems
Mini Project - Mentored by IBM &amp; ICTAcademy

This project is dedicated to the continuous monitoring of key oceanic parameters such as pH, turbidity, and temperature. The sensed values from these parameters are seamlessly displayed on the home screen of a customized application crafted with MIT App Inventor. In instances of deteriorating water quality, SMS alerts are generated.

Hardware/Software used: Raspberry Pi 3, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson IoT Platform, Node Red , MIT App Inventor, FAST2SMS, Twilio.
Technology Stack: Internet of Things, Cloud, Python IDLE.
